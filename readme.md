# Test app to benchmark performance with passing state, and lifting state up

This is a test application to benchmark performance (at your will) on React components which pass state through props, and lifts the state upwards.

Only the root component is a stateful component, and the rest are stateless components.

### Starting the application

Using yarn,
```
yarn
yarn start
```

Or if using npm,

```
npm install
npm start
```
